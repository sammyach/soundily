This is an open source project intended to house and make available all everyday-sounds we hear around us. Users can select a particular sound to play that suit their current mood, for example, when they are ðŸ˜” or ðŸ˜Ÿ or ðŸ˜Š or ðŸ˜‚.


## Tools
- Built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.
- Font awesome icons (v4.7)
- Sound files are recorded with my phone
- Audacity software to edit the final sound files
